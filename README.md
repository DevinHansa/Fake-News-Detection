# Fake News Detection Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting fake news articles. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled news articles, where each article is labeled as either fake or genuine. The goal is to create a classifier that can accurately predict whether a given news article is fake or genuine based on its content.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model consists of news articles along with their corresponding labels (fake or genuine). It is sourced from [provide source if applicable].

## Preprocessing
Before training the model, the text data undergoes preprocessing to clean and prepare it for analysis. Typical preprocessing steps include:
- Lowercasing the text
- Removing punctuation
- Tokenization
- Removing stopwords
- Vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF)

## Model Training
The preprocessed text data is used to train a machine learning model, such as a Logistic Regression classifier or a Random Forest classifier. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and learns to classify news articles as fake or genuine based on the features extracted from the text.

## Evaluation
The performance of the trained model is evaluated using various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, a confusion matrix may be generated to visualize the model's performance on the test data.

## Manual Testing
A function is provided for manual testing of the model. Users can input a news article, and the model will predict whether it is fake or genuine based on its content.

## Usage
To use the model for manual testing, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (e.g., scikit-learn).
3. Run the `manual_testing` function with a news article as input to get the model's prediction.
